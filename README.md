A repository of Delay Discounting Scripts for PBCAR

## Delay Discounting Script

This script processes both DD $100 and DD $1000 questionnaires. For each questionnaire, the participant's k-value is calculated if the control question was answered correctly. The script is set up to process data whereby the immediate reward == 2, and the delayed reward == 1.
