# DelayDiscounting Repository

A repository of Delay Discounting Scripts for PBCAR

## Delay Discounting Script

This script processes both DD $100 and DD $1000 questionnaires. For each questionnaire, the participant's k-value is calculated if the control question was answered correctly.

The script is set up to process data whereby the immediate reward == 2, and the delayed reward == 1. It can also process data with responses as strings.

Currently, it processes the DD $100 and DD $1000 questionnaires each with 31 items (plus 1 control question).
